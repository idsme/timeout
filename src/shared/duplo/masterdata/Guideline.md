# Every app has masterdata and process data.
* This part of the app deals with the near static data lists.

TODO IDSME techincal dept. Create a Masterdata service which just gets a countries.json file from the server and uses it.
We should have a simple service which loads masterdata from the server and updates this data in a config or masterdata-service.ts file.
Which we can then use throughout the app.
